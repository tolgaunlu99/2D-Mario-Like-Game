A challenging 2D platformer inspired by Mario – dodge saws, spikes, and the Mask Dude to reach the flag and collect cherries!
# Just in Time Games – 2D Mario-Inspired Platformer

This is a 2D platformer game built as a final project for CENG 454. It draws inspiration from classic Mario-style games but ramps up the difficulty with unique threats and agile mechanics that demand fast reflexes and strategy.

## 🎮 Game Overview

- **Move Left:** `A` key  
- **Move Right:** `D` key  
- **Jump:** `Space` key

The goal is to **reach the flag** at the end of each level, **avoid deadly threats**, and **collect cherries** along the way for bonus achievement.

## 💀 Game Threats

- **🔧 Rotating Saws:** Move in unpredictable patterns – horizontally, vertically, and in circles. They are fast and unforgiving.
- **📌 Spikes:** Hidden in tight spaces and placed strategically to punish missteps. Small but deadly.
- **🎭 Mask Dude:** The most dangerous enemy in the game. Shoots bullets constantly. The only way to defeat him is by getting close enough to touch.

## 🎯 Objective

- **Survive the traps**
- **Collect as many cherries as possible**
- **Reach the flag without dying**
